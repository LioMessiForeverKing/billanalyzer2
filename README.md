Bill Analyzer is an innovative app developed during my internship at Google Public Policy, designed to assess the political leanings of U.S. legislative bills. While bills are often introduced as bipartisan, they typically exhibit subtle leanings towards either Democratic or Republican values. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and the Library of Congress API, I built a machine learning model using Python and TensorFlow to analyze the text of legislative bills. The model was trained to identify patterns and linguistic cues that align with the ideologies of each party.

Users can interact with the application through an intuitive user interface, where they input the bill number and the respective Congress session number. Once submitted, the app processes the bill and returns a score that reflects the likely political leaning, with an accuracy rate of approximately 70%. This score provides insight into whether the bill is more aligned with Democratic or Republican perspectives. The combination of advanced NLP and machine learning makes Bill Analyzer a valuable tool for researchers, policymakers, and anyone interested in understanding the underlying biases in legislative proposals, offering a more transparent view of political tendencies in policy-making.
